Magic Smoke refers to the old joke for catastrophically failing pieces of electrical hardware: they don't work anymore because all the "magic smoke" has been let out. In the piece, I amplify the magic smoke contained within my laptop and cell phone through the use of a telephone pickup, an inexpensive device typically used to record telephone conversations through picking up the electromagnetic field emitted by the receiver's voice coil. Utilizing looping and live processing code I've developed in the SuperCollider programming language, I weave together layers of processed buzzes and hums to build dense sonic clouds that gradually evolve throughout time.
