My first real Max/MSP project. I performed two realizations of John Cage's Fontana Mix simultaneously, one electronically and one acoustically through found objects. Although the samples are fixed in time, chance processes in Max determine various aspects of DSP processes, including FFT frequency bandpass filtering, pitchshifting, and the execution of synthesized sounds.
