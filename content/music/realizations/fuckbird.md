A project to realize Liza Lim's postcard piece _Love Letter_ written for Eugene Ughetti of Speak Percussion. My version utilizes code written in SuperCollider to process the sounds of my frame drum and sonifies the letter James Joyce wrote to Nora Joyce dated December 8, 1909. Of particular interest to me in this project is how such vulgar text can be rendered tame by its transformation into sound. Despite this fascination, I make referenes to both the act of letter writing and the content of the letter.
