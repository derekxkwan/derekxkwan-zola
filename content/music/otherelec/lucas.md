A first foray into really investigating Pure Data's capabilities as a sequencer for more rhythmic music. The melodies of this tune are based on Lucas numbers, which are similar to Fibonacci numbers where each term is derived from the sum of the previous two terms. In this case, the starting two terms are L[0] = 2 and L[1] = 1. Thus, L[3] = 3, L[4] = 4, L[5] = 7 and so on. For lucas-1%14_0116, I had to scale these numbers down by subtracting each term by 1 and modding by 14 (hence -1%14).
