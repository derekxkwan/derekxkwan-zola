+++
Near-half-hour, ambient, electronic composition realized in Pure Data based on a recording of the 52-Hz whale, a supposed whale that uniquely sings at 52 Hz. This is reflected in the droning swells of a sine oscillator at 52 Hz throughout much of the piece. All sounds are synthesized in Pure Data, aside from Freesound CC-0 samples of rivers (one FFT-transformed). Most of the pitched material is in 15-EDO (equal divisions of the octave).
